# This Dockerfile is used to build a Node.js application image.
# It consists of multiple stages to optimize the build process and reduce image size.

# - Sets the working directory to /usr/src/app
# - Copies package.json and package-lock.json (if exists) to the working directory
FROM node:${NODE_VERSION}-alpine AS base

# Stage 2: Dependencies
# - Uses the baseImage as the starting point
# - Installs project dependencies using npm
# - Utilizes Docker build cache for faster builds

# - Copies the entire project to the working directory
# - Sets the default command to run the development server
